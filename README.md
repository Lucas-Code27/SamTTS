# Uses
This is a basic system for Windows that allows you to speak into your microphone and a vosk model will turn your speech into text to be fed into SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) to be spoken

# Requirements
The virtual pip environment (Included)
Python
VB-Cable (if you want to use this as your microphone input)

# How to use
Set your computer speakers in settings to be VB-Cable Input and set all other apps besides sam to run with your normal speakers (IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS IT WILL PLAY ALONGSIDE YOUR SAM AUDIO)
Set the app microphone to use VB-Cable output
Speak (I do not know a way to hear sam audio and other audio at the same time as of right now but I hope to figure it out soon)
